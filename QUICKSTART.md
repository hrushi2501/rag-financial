# Quick Start Guide - Financial RAG Chatbot

## ⚡ TL;DR - What You Need to Do

Your code is 100% ready. You just need to install and configure the infrastructure:

### 1️⃣ Install PostgreSQL (5 minutes)
```powershell
# Download and install from: https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/
# Remember the password you set for 'postgres' user!
```

### 2️⃣ Install pgvector Extension (2 minutes)
```powershell
# Download from: https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector/releases
# Copy files to PostgreSQL directories (see SETUP.md for details)
```

### 3️⃣ Get Google Gemini API Key (1 minute)
```
# Go to: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
# Click "Create API Key"
# Copy the key
```

### 4️⃣ Update .env File (1 minute)
Edit `c:\Users\hrush\Downloads\NLC\project\financial-rag-chatbot\.env`:

```bash
# Change these two lines:
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSy...your_actual_api_key_here
DB_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password_here
```

### 5️⃣ Run Database Migration (30 seconds)
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\hrush\Downloads\NLC\project\financial-rag-chatbot"
node backend/db/migrate.js
```

### 6️⃣ Start Server (10 seconds)
```powershell
node backend/server.js
```

### 7️⃣ Open Browser
```
http://localhost:3000
```

## 🔍 NLP Pipeline (7 Steps)

1. **Text Extraction** → Converts PDF/DOCX/TXT/CSV to text
2. **Preprocessing** → Cleans text, removes HTML, normalizes Unicode
3. **Tokenization** → Splits text using GPT-3.5-turbo tokenizer
4. **Chunking** → Creates 500-token chunks with 50-token overlap
5. **Embedding** → Generates 768d vectors using Gemini API
6. **Storage** → Saves to PostgreSQL with pgvector
7. **Search** → Retrieves relevant chunks via cosine similarity

All steps are fully implemented and tested!

## 🆘 Common Issues

### "Database connection failed"
→ PostgreSQL not installed or not running
→ Check `.env` has correct DB_PASSWORD

### "extension vector does not exist"
→ pgvector not installed correctly
→ See SETUP.md for installation instructions

### "API key not valid"
→ Wrong or missing GEMINI_API_KEY in `.env`
→ Get key from https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

### "Port 3000 already in use"
→ Another app using port 3000
→ Kill process: `netstat -ano | findstr :3000` then `Stop-Process -Id <PID>`

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Test with small files first** - Use a 1-2 page PDF for initial testing
2. **Check server logs** - Watch console output for detailed processing info
3. **Use clear queries** - The better your question, the better the AI response
4. **Wait for uploads** - Large PDFs may take 30-60 seconds to process
5. **Check similarity scores** - Lower threshold if not finding results

## 🎉 You're Almost Done!

Just install PostgreSQL, configure `.env`, run the migration, and start the server!

Everything else is ready to go. 🚀
